Commit #1: initial index.html by Mubasshir Al Shahriar Date, Time: July 24, around 9:50 p.m

Making the actual first commit by adding the initial index.html. Might need to make changes/modify later according to the upcoming files and the files Md Akram Hossain working on. This commit will allow me to see the basic/initial structure of the home/starting page. Next, I will put an initial CSS file focusing on only this page. Md Akram Hossain is working on actual well made CSS file which will make most of the .html pages way better. Until I hear back from Hossain with the updated CSS, I will have this .html and initial testing CSS file.
