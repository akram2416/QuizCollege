### Commit #1: Initial index.html  
**Author**: Mubasshir Al Shahriar  
**Date, Time**: July 24, ~9:50 p.m.  

- Created the initial `index.html` file.  
- This commit establishes the basic structure of the homepage.  
- Changes or modifications may be needed later based on upcoming files and Md Akram Hossain’s contributions.  
- Next step: Create an initial CSS file specifically for this page.  
- Md Akram Hossain is working on a comprehensive CSS file to enhance the styling of all `.html` pages. Until the updated CSS is received, this `index.html` and a temporary testing CSS file will be used.

### Commit #3: Created a testing CSS file for index.html  
**Author**: Mubasshir Al Shahriar  
**Date, Time**: July 24, ~10:45 p.m.  

- This is just a basic testing CSS file to check and take decision about index.html. Md Akram Hossain will replace this one with an enhanced CSS file, where Mubasshir Al Shahriar and Md Akram Hossain both are currently working on.
- This is a temporary styling solution to visualize the appearance of the index page.  
- The CSS is a modified version of a previous testing file.  
- Awaiting Md Akram Hossain’s comprehensive CSS file, which I contributed too, to replace this temporary version.


### Commit #4: Uploaded the backend folder with some required backend files  
**Author**: Md Akram Hossain

<!--Expecting Md Akram Hossain to update this part here and write what he uploaded just to keep track-->....   


### Commit #5: Pushed quiz.html front end file  
**Author**: Mubasshir Al Shahriar  
**Date, Time**: July 25, ~07:36 p.m.  

- This html file contains the basic structure and main interface of the quiz page. 
- As I am not done with the app.js server-side work yet, also have not pushed that yet, and the CSS file is not completely ready yet, this file should only show the skeleton version. - To make it actually dynamic, and to make the questions appear, I am working on server-side part too, which I will push next. 
- Also, on this file, have added a script with a relative part of 2 sound file, which I am trying to make working, but need to wait until I finish the app.js part and also choose and upload actual sound tracks.


### Commit #6: Pushed app.js file  
**Author**: Mubasshir Al Shahriar  
**Date, Time**: July 25, ~08:45 p.m.  


- Current version (till now) completely coded by me.
- This file contains almost all main frontend logic for all dynamic features and makes connection between files. 
- I have created this and tested this locally with other sample files, it is working correctly. 
- Might need to make some changes later to host and make it live properly. 
- This app.js handles page switching, built for API requests (will have to work more if need anything else later), timer, sound effects, dark mode, answer selection, score computation etc. 
- It basically controls the navigation and user experience across all pages too. 
- Though I have not put any audio track in Github's directory yet (as of 8:45 pm, July 25), in my local machine (my laptop) I have tested with sample sound track too and it worked well after some trial and error. 
- Next, I will upload appropriate sound track, adjust the path/directory in quiz.html file if needed. Then, I will work further with the CSS file and study the files Md Akram Hossain working on and make any adjustment if necessary. 
- Once these are done, I will start working on backend hosting. 


### Commit #7: Pushed app.js file  
**Author**: Mubasshir Al Shahriar  
**Date, Time**: July 25, ~09:35 p.m.
- Chose and downloaded a short audio file. 
- Implementing it through app.js and adding it to quiz.html page to play after answering each question to let user instantly know if their attempt going correct or wrong.
- Tested it locally, working correctly.
