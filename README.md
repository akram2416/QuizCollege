- This commit establishes the basic structure of the homepage.  
- Changes or modifications may be needed later based on upcoming files and Md Akram Hossain’s contributions.  
- Next step: Create an initial CSS file specifically for this page.  
- Md Akram Hossain is working on a comprehensive CSS file to enhance the styling of all `.html` pages. Until the updated CSS is received, this `index.html` and a temporary testing CSS file will be used.

### Commit #3: Created a testing CSS file for index.html  
**Author**: Mubasshir Al Shahriar  
**Date, Time**: July 24, ~10:45 p.m.  

- This is just a basic testing CSS file to check and take decision about index.html. Md Akram Hossain will replace this one with an enhanced CSS file, where Mubasshir Al Shahriar and Md Akram Hossain both are currently working on.
- This is a temporary styling solution to visualize the appearance of the index page.  
- The CSS is a modified version of a previous testing file.  
- Awaiting Md Akram Hossain’s comprehensive CSS file, which I contributed too, to replace this temporary version.


### Commit #4: Uploaded the backend folder with some required backend files  
**Author**: Md Akram Hossain

<!--Expecting Md Akram Hossain to update this part here and write what he uploaded just to keep track-->....   


### Commit #5: Pushed quiz.html front end file  
**Author**: Mubasshir Al Shahriar  
**Date, Time**: July 25, ~07:36 p.m.  

- This html file contains the basic structure and main interface of the quiz page. 
- As I am not done with the app.js server-side work yet, also have not pushed that yet, and the CSS file is not completely ready yet, this file should only show the skeleton version. - To make it actually dynamic, and to make the questions appear, I am working on server-side part too, which I will push next. 
- Also, on this file, have added a script with a relative part of 2 sound file, which I am trying to make working, but need to wait until I finish the app.js part and also choose and upload actual sound tracks.
